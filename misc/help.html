        <h3>Getting your images on the site</h3>
        <p>
            As of now, I have now automated way to upload pictures to the site without my own input. So, as of now, you'll have to email me the pictures and some other info so that I can create the page for
            your coin by hand. In the future, I plan on changing this system to be more user friendly and quicker, but that isn't possible at this current moment. To send an email, use the template below and once
            you have filled it out, send your fully filled template to bizzeebear@hotmail.com, and I will get to adding your coins and their page.
        </p>
        <h3>Email Template:</h3>
        <p>
            Name: (name here if requested leave blank to remain anonymous)
            <br>
            Coin Details: (Name, Mint, Date, Country of Origin, Condition, Value(?))
            <br>
            Pictures: (preferably both obverse and reverse)
            <br>
            Date of Picture: (If applicable)
        </p>
        <p>All you have to do is copy and paste this into your preferred emailling service, and replace the different inputs where parenthesis can be found with the information that belongs.</p>

        <h3>Image Edit Requests and Page Edit Requests</h3>
        <p>If you are not happy with how I have implemented your page, you can make a simple request for me to change it. All you have to do is email me with the name of the coin you uploaded, your own name,
            and the edits you would like me to make. I will be happy to change up your page as long as it doesn't mean having to change core design elements of the website itself. (e.g. Page background). If you
            aren't happy with how an image looks after being uploaded, then you can do the same as you would if you were to request a page edit change, but instead of sending me your page edit requests, send me the
            image you'd rather having displayed on the site.
