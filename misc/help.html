        <h3 id="custom">Getting your images on the site</h3>
        <p>
            As of now, I have no automated way to upload pictures to the site without my own input. So, as of now, you'll have to email me the pictures and some other info so that I can create the page for
            your coin by hand. In the future, I plan on changing this system to be more user friendly and quicker, but that isn't possible at this current moment. To send an email, use the template below and once
            you have filled it out, send your fully filled template to bizzeebear@hotmail.com, and I will get to adding your coins and their page.
        </p>
        <h3>Email Template:</h3>
        <p>
            Name: (name here if requested leave blank to remain anonymous)
            <br>
            Coin Details: (Name, Mint, Date, Country of Origin, Condition, Value(?))
            <br>
            Pictures: (preferably both obverse and reverse)
            <br>
            Date of Picture: (If applicable)
        </p>
        <p>All you have to do is copy and paste this into your preferred emailling service, and replace the different inputs where parenthesis can be found with the information that belongs.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Image Edit Requests and Page Edit Requests</h3>
        <p>If you are not happy with how I have implemented your page, you can make a simple request for me to change it. All you have to do is email me with the name of the coin you uploaded, your own name,
            and the edits you would like me to make. I will be happy to change up your page as long as it doesn't mean having to change core design elements of the website itself. (e.g. Page background). If you
            aren't happy with how an image looks after being uploaded, then you can do the same as you would if you were to request a page edit change, but instead of sending me your page edit requests, send me the
            image you'd rather having displayed on the site.
        </p>

        <h2 id="purchasing">Purchasing Coins</h2>
        <p>
            Just like how I have no automated way to add coins to the website, there is no automated way to purchase coins. Therefore, purchases must be made throught the old fashion way of agreeing on
            a price through email (bizzeebear@hotmail.com), I send you an invoice with all the fees and cost added up, then lastly once paid, I will ship your coin out to you. Shipping fees will vary depending on which country you are in. Some
            items found on the site do not have values listeded. This is either because the item just hasn't had that information given yet, or the item is too common where the value fluctuation is too small.
        </p>
        <h3>Shipping Rates</h3>
        <p>US: Free</p>
        <p>Canada: $1.50</p>
        <p>International: $2.00</p>
        <h3>Payment</h3>
        <p>
            As previously mentioned, payment will be done through an invoice I send you, where you then use (preferably) paypal to buy the item. For foreign currencies, PayPal will automatically convert your
            currency to mine (USD) and vice versa. This is why I'd prefer people use PayPal to purchase the coins.
        </p>
        <h3>Shipping</h3>
        <p>
            Shipping is done through USPS so international shipping costs may be a bit more expensive. However, this may not be the case as I might decide on using a different service for international shipments.
            This doesn't apply to Canada however, where even with using USPS the fee isn't that much higher than if I was doing a national shipment. The shipping fee for Canada will remain at $1.50 until I can
            adjust the price.
